# CPP Source Code
Source code sample of HF project for JobApplication evaluations.

# Source folder

Contains a snapshot of the source of a game I'm doing on my spare time, with some C++ knowledge and Pathfinder written from scratch by myself.
I do have deeper c++ game samples, but I'm limited by game studio agreements.

# Plugins folder

Contains two of my most used private plugins on projects.
They are here to exemplify how I modularize code between multiple unreal engine projects.
