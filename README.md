# hellfable-source-code
Source code sample of hellfable project for JobApplication evaluations.

# Source folder

Contains the source of a game I'm doing by myself, with some C++ knowledge and Pathfinder written from scratch by myself. I do have deeper c++ game samples, but I'm limited by game studio agreements.

# Plugins folder

Contains two of my most used private plugins on projects.
They are here to exemplify how I modularize code between multiple unreal engine projects.
